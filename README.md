Weekly Auto-Reporting System (Week 7 Capstone)

A CLI-first automation system that ingests survey files, cleans and deduplicates data, computes KPIs, generates report artifacts, writes logs and health status, and optionally emails results with attachments.
Designed to run unattended via Windows Task Scheduler.

What this project does

On each run, the system:

Scans an inbox folder for new input files (CSV / Excel / JSON)

Cleans and deduplicates records

Computes KPIs (satisfaction, recommendation, usage, etc.)

Writes report artifacts to output/

Archives processed inputs

Updates logs and a health/status file

Optionally emails reports as attachments

Runtime folders are created automatically if missing.

Requirements

Python 3.10+ (tested with Python 3.14)

Windows (PowerShell examples shown)

Dependencies:

pandas

openpyxl (for Excel inputs)

Installation (recommended: virtual environment)

From the project root:

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e .


Verify installation:

python -m weekly_report --help

Configuration (config.json)

Edit config.json to match:

input/output directories

input file patterns

column names (service, region, satisfaction, recommendation, etc.)

email settings (optional)

Input files must be placed in:

data/inbox/


Supported formats:

CSV

XLSX

JSON

Running the system
Validate configuration
python -m weekly_report validate-config

Dry run (safe simulation)
python -m weekly_report run --dry-run

Full run
python -m weekly_report run

Verbose debug logging

Global flags must come before the command:

python -m weekly_report --verbose run --dry-run

Check last run status
python -m weekly_report status

Outputs

After a run, check:

Reports: output/

Logs: logs/app.log

Health/status file: output/health.txt

Both the log file and the health file update on every run.

Inputs are archived unchanged in data/processed/. Cleaned/deduped outputs are written to output/.

Scheduling (Windows Task Scheduler)

Recommended execution (no activation required):

Program/script

C:\path\to\project\.venv\Scripts\python.exe


Arguments

-m weekly_report run


Start in

C:\path\to\project


This ensures relative paths and config.json resolve correctly.

Exit codes (automation-friendly)

0 — success

1 — bad CLI arguments

2 — pipeline failure

3 — configuration error
