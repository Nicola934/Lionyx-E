__all__ = [] # This file indicates that the weekly_report directory is a Python package.
# When the package is imported, no specific modules or attributes are exposed by default.
# The __all__ list is empty, meaning that if someone imports the package using from weekly_report import *,
# no modules or attributes will be imported automatically.
# This is often done to control the public interface of a package and prevent unintended imports.
